Rhyolite adds a new minibiome called (you guessed it) Rhyolite to the underground, like Marble and Granite.
It generates right above Underworld, opening up into it. It will also be a part of an upcoming mod called Xenon as well.

The mod contains:
- The biome (it generates 2 per world, no matter the size)
- The full Rhyolite furniture set
- Smooth Rhyolite Blocks
- Shimmer recipes for swapping Marble, Granite, and Rhyolite
- 2 mobs for the Rhyolite biome:
 * Rhyolite Slimer
 * Lava Worm



ALSO: The mod is looking for someone to update the sprites for various recolors or slight edits to the sprites in the mod.


Updates:

v1.1
- Fixed the interior of the biome's tunnel having weird spike-like things (it now is correctly random-looking)
- Fixed Rhyolite furniture that emits light emitting the wrong color of light
- Fixed backwalls extending too far above and below the biome
- Fixed unsafe Rhyolite Walls dropping the safe wall item

v1.2
- Changed how the top and bottom of the biome generate; they are now more jagged and blend better with the surrounding terrain/blocks

v1.3
- Fixed alignment of 4 tilesheets
- Added Biome Titles support (without an icon sadly)

v1.4
- Fixed Rhyolite cabins having patches of no walls
- Added small hanging lava pools to the sides of the Rhyolite cave gen
- Added a small icon for the mod
- Fixed Rhyolite cave mobs not dropping Rhyolite Blocks at the proper chance
- Added a config option to allow between 2 and 4 Rhyolite caves in a world (default is 2)
- Added Tuna Melt food item
- Added Fossilized Blessing accessory
- Added Eruption in a Bottle accessory
